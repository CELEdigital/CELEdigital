      <description>&lt;p&gt;Different civil society organizations, union representatives and delegates of the Argentine State participated on November 19 in the hearing on the situation of freedom of expression in Argentina convened by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The session is the result of two requests promoted by civil society organizations, academia and experts. CELE was one of the organizations that supported the request made by the Argentine Journalism Forum (FOPEA).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The participating organizations denounced a rapid and pronounced deterioration in the conditions for journalistic practice in Argentina.  They pointed out a significant increase in attacks against journalists, ranging from internet violence and harassment to physical violence, and many times carried out by public authorities. CELE had already highlighted and analyzed this situation, also noted in the most recent report of the Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression (RELE) of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights.  FOPEA described as “narratives of hate and misinformation” the ongoing patterns of attacks by public government officials, used strategically for silencing through the restriction of public debate, especially by President Javier Milei, who stated, on repeated occasions, that “we do not hate journalists enough.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Data Access for Researchers</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 2 July 2025, the European Commission adopted delegated legislation relating to data access for researchers under Article 40(4) of the Digital Services Act (DSA). This is a long-awaited milestone; a rule that, if successfully implemented, could allow access to a large amount of information about the operation of online platforms that remains outside public knowledge to date. At CELE we have been following this conversation for some time and have participated - together with InternetLab - in the consultation process with comments on a preliminary version of this regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
