description: "CELE produces quality research, and distributes it in different formats. We work on doctrinal approaches to freedom of expression and fundamental rights, free speech theory, and human rights law. We are, however, an interdisciplinary center and value collaboration with non-legal researchers in the social and computer sciences. We also produce empirical research based on data gathering and analyses. Our 15-years of history can be found here and in our [CELE Research Paper Series](https://www.ssrn.com/index.cfm/en/cele-res/) at SSRN."
