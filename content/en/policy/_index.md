description: "The mission of CELE, since its founding, involves the defense of freedom of expression as a fundamental right for the functioning of the democratic system. Although we are an academic research center, we have positions taken when the right is in question or is threatened. We intervene in the public debate by offering analysis and expert knowledge on the legal framework, at the national, regional, and international levels, with a special focus on international human rights standards."
